<Project Description>
(1) Requirements

In order to complete a well-structured requirements document, please refer to the template of requirements document. The purpose of this document is for you to get a better understanding of what is expected. The project specification is vague.

(2) Analysis and Design

In order to complete a well-structured design document, please refer to the template of design document. And the important sections of this document are section 4 & 5.

For Section 4 (System Architecture), in addition to the descriptions for subsystems, component or object, you are also required to give a dataflow diagram (please refer to the diagrams in chapter 12 of textbook)

For Section 5 (Detailed System Design), in addition to the highly detailed description of your subsystem, component or object, you are also required to give detailed class diagrams (please refer to the Figure 14.11 in textbook).

(3) Test Plan

In order to complete a well-structured test document, please refer to the template of test plan document.

To ensure that your project can meet the requirements, you should give test information in detail for all units (Section 3) and the whole system (Section 4). The specific requirements for each part of these sections have been included in the template of test plan document. For unit testing, test cases for a certain testing unit can be considered as different scenarios. At least, you should give one passing case and one exceptional case for each unit.

(4) Final Project Deliverables

A short 5 minutes demonstration is required with the TA before the end of finals week. You should demonstrate that the application meets the requirements as specified in the project description (Grading sheet). In addition, you should run the unit tests for the TA. A one page project summary is required. Talk about the structure of the code / tests and any challenges you experienced while working on the project. Please talk about any special features you developed in your application above and beyond the requirements. These extra features may be awarded extra credit at the discretion of the TA, however, all functional requirements must be met first! Please check in your code and project summary into the version control repository.
